To call your Supabase Edge Function using Postman, follow these steps:

### 1. **Open Postman**
   - If you donâ€™t have Postman installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### 2. **Set the HTTP Method**
   - In Postman, create a new request and set the method to `POST` because your function expects a `POST` request.

### 3. **Set the URL**
   - Use the URL of your Supabase Edge Function: `https://xxllfyzeciydpjwwyeef.supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world`

### 4. **Add the Request Body**
   - Under the **Body** tab in Postman, choose **raw** and select **JSON** from the dropdown.
   - Add the JSON body that your function expects. For example:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "John"
     }
     ```

### 5. **Set Headers**
   - Go to the **Headers** tab in Postman and ensure you have the following header:
     - **Content-Type**: `application/json`

### 6. **Send the Request**
   - After configuring the request, click on **Send**.
   - You should receive a response with the `message` property in JSON format, like this:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Hello John!"
     }
     ```

### Additional Notes:
- If your Edge Function is secured (requires authentication), you may need to add an authorization token in the **Authorization** tab in Postman.
- Ensure the function is deployed and running on Supabase when testing.
