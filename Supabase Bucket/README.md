The error is due to the incorrect use of `storage.foldername(name)[1]`. Supabase SQL does not support accessing array indices like this directly.  

### âœ… **Corrected Policy Query**
Use the `name LIKE` condition instead of `storage.foldername(name)[1]`:

```sql
create policy "Allow user to manage own images"
on storage.objects
for all
using (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND bucket_id = 'assets'
  AND name LIKE 'profile_pictures/%'
);
```

---

### âœ… **Alternative: Restrict Users to Their Own Files**
If you want users to **only manage their own images**, update the policy like this:

```sql
create policy "Allow user to manage their own images"
on storage.objects
for all
using (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND bucket_id = 'assets'
  AND name LIKE 'profile_pictures/' || auth.uid() || '%'
);
```
---

### **ðŸ”¹ Why This Works**
- âœ… The **first policy** allows all authenticated users to upload to the `profile_pictures/` folder.
- âœ… The **second policy** restricts users to **only modifying their own files** based on their `auth.uid()`.

### **ðŸ”„ Next Steps**
1. **Run the correct policy SQL in Supabase**.
2. **Test the image upload again** in your Flutter app.

ðŸš€ **This should now fix the 403 Unauthorized error!** ðŸŽ¯
