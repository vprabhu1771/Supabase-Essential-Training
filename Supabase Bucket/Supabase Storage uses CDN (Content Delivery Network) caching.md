This issue happens because Supabase Storage uses **CDN (Content Delivery Network) caching** for public assets. Even after manually deleting a file, the CDN might still serve the old cached version for some time.

---

### ‚úÖ **Fix: Force a New URL for the Updated Image**
Since Supabase Storage does not auto-invalidate CDN cache when a file is deleted and re-uploaded with the same name, you need to **ensure a unique filename** every time.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Use a Unique File Name**
Modify your `_uploadImage()` function to append a timestamp to the filename:
```dart
final fileName = '${user.id}_${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}.jpg';
final filePath = 'profile_pictures/$fileName';
```
This ensures each new upload has a **unique filename**, preventing cached versions from being served.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Bypass CDN Cache by Adding a Query Parameter**
If you must keep the same file name, **append a cache-busting query string** to the URL:
```dart
final imageUrl = '${supabase.storage.from('assets').getPublicUrl(filePath)}?t=${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}';
```
This forces the browser/CDN to load the latest image instead of the cached one.

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Purge Supabase CDN Cache (Only for Private Buckets)**
If the bucket is **private**, you can use Supabase's built-in mechanism to invalidate cache:
```dart
await supabase.storage.from('assets').update(filePath, _image!);
```
However, this does **not** work for public buckets.

### **üî• Best Practice: Always Use Unique Filenames**
- **Best Fix**: Change filename (`user.id_timestamp.jpg`).
- **Quick Fix**: Append a `?t=timestamp` query parameter.
- **Last Resort**: Manually wait for CDN cache expiry (could take hours).

üöÄ **Try these and let me know if you need more help!**

For a **quick fix**, modify how you retrieve the public URL by appending a **cache-busting query parameter**:  

### ‚úÖ **Updated Code**
Replace:
```dart
final imageUrl = supabase.storage.from('assets').getPublicUrl(filePath);
```
With:
```dart
final imageUrl = '${supabase.storage.from('assets').getPublicUrl(filePath)}?t=${DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch}';
```

### üî• **Why This Works?**
- The `?t=timestamp` forces the browser and CDN to load a fresh image instead of a cached one.  
- The Supabase URL stays the same, but the CDN treats it as a "new" request.

Now, when you upload a new image, the **latest image will be displayed instead of the old cached one**. üöÄ Try it and let me know if you need more help!
